## Work

I'm a Front-end Consultant, currently working at Ahold Delhaize.

On a working day, I care about bringing the best web experience to end users. Carefully thinking about the optimized front-end part of the website. Validating use cases, improving website speed but also pragmatically improve (technical) parts of the ecosystem.

## Hobby

After a working day I really like to cook some food, drink a glass of wine and enjoy. Next to that I have several other hobbies.

### Photography 📷

I take a lot of photos, during a walk or holidays. It's a challenge for me to go out, with minimal gear and deliver the most exciting composition and detail.
Some organisations requested me to take photo's at their event, <a href="https://ladolcevita-more.com/albums/" target="_blank">view photos</a>.

Some photos are available to buy:
